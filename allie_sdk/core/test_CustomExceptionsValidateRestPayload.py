**Scenario 1: Valid Payload with Single Expected Type**
Details:
  TestName: test_validate_payload_single_valid_type
  Description: Tests that the validate_rest_payload function does not raise an exception when all items in the payload match the single expected type.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a list of instances of a single dataclass type.
  Act: Pass the payload list and a tuple containing just this dataclass type to the validate_rest_payload function.
  Assert: Check that no exception is raised.
Validation:
  Verifying that the function correctly identifies and accepts all instances of the correct type aligns with its purpose of validating payload types against expected dataclass types.

**Scenario 2: Valid Payload with Multiple Expected Types**
Details:
  TestName: test_validate_payload_multiple_valid_types
  Description: Tests that the validate_rest_payload function does not raise an exception when all items in the payload match any of the multiple expected types.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a list of instances, each of different types, all of which are included in the expected types.
  Act: Pass the payload list and a tuple containing these types to the validate_rest_payload function.
  Assert: Check that no exception is raised.
Validation:
  Ensures the function can handle multiple acceptable types and correctly validates each item against a list of expected types, which is crucial for flexible API payloads.

**Scenario 3: Invalid Payload Type**
Details:
  TestName: test_validate_payload_with_invalid_type
  Description: Tests that the validate_rest_payload function raises an UnsupportedPostBody exception when an item in the payload does not match any of the expected types.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a list containing instances where at least one instance is not of the expected type.
  Act: Pass the payload list and a tuple of expected types to the validate_rest_payload function.
  Assert: Check that an UnsupportedPostBody exception is raised.
Validation:
  This test verifies the function's ability to enforce type constraints, which is essential for maintaining API integrity and preventing errors due to incorrect payload types.

**Scenario 4: Empty Payload**
Details:
  TestName: test_validate_empty_payload
  Description: Tests that the validate_rest_payload function handles an empty payload list without raising an exception.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty list and a tuple of one or more expected types.
  Act: Pass the empty list and the tuple to the validate_rest_payload function.
  Assert: Check that no exception is raised.
Validation:
  Validates that the function gracefully handles an empty payload, which might be a valid scenario in certain API calls and should not be treated as an error.

**Scenario 5: Payload with None Elements**
Details:
  TestName: test_validate_payload_with_none
  Description: Tests that the validate_rest_payload function raises an UnsupportedPostBody exception if any item in the payload is None, assuming None is not a valid type.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a list containing valid instances and at least one None element, with a tuple of expected types.
  Act: Pass this list and the tuple to the validate_rest_payload function.
  Assert: Check that an UnsupportedPostBody exception is raised.
Validation:
  Ensures that the function properly rejects None values, which are typically not valid dataclass instances, thus preserving the integrity and the expected structure of the payload.

**Scenario 6: No Expected Types Provided**
Details:
  TestName: test_validate_no_expected_types
  Description: Tests that the validate_rest_payload function behaves correctly (potentially raising an exception) when no expected types are provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a list of any valid instances and an empty tuple for expected types.
  Act: Pass the list and the empty tuple to the validate_rest_payload function.
  Assert: Define the expected behavior, whether an error should be raised or handled silently.
Validation:
  Checks the robustness of the function when encountering configuration or usage errors, such as the omission of expected types, which could indicate issues in upstream code or API misuse.
