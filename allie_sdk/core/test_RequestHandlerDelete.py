### Scenario 1: Successful DELETE Request with Valid JSON Body
Details:
  TestName: test_delete_with_valid_json_body
  Description: Verify that the delete method handles a successful API DELETE request when provided with a valid JSON body.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the session's DELETE method to return a response object with status code 200 (HTTP OK) and a JSON content.
  Act: Call the delete method with a valid URL and a JSON body.
  Assert: Check that the method returns the correct response data as JSON.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the delete method correctly processes and returns data when the API call is successful, meeting the expectations for handling standard DELETE requests with a JSON payload.

### Scenario 2: DELETE Request with Non-JSON Response
Details:
  TestName: test_delete_with_non_json_response
  Description: Test the delete method's ability to handle a response that does not contain JSON data.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the session's DELETE method to return a response object with status code 200 and plain text content.
  Act: Call the delete method with a valid URL and an optional body.
  Assert: Verify that the method returns the plain text content correctly decoded.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the delete method can gracefully handle and return non-JSON responses, which is critical for robustness in varied API response scenarios.

### Scenario 3: DELETE Request with Network Failure
Details:
  TestName: test_delete_with_network_failure
  Description: Ensure that the delete method handles exceptions raised due to network-related issues like connection timeouts.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the session's DELETE method to raise a `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`.
  Act: Call the delete method with any URL and body.
  Assert: Expect the method to handle the exception and perhaps log the error without crashing.
Validation:
  Testing how the delete method deals with network failures is crucial for assessing the resilience and stability of the method under adverse conditions.

### Scenario 4: DELETE Request with HTTP Error Status Code
Details:
  TestName: test_delete_with_http_error_status_code
  Description: Test how the delete method logs errors and handles non-success HTTP status codes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the session's DELETE method to return a response object with a status code like 404 (Not Found) and a specific error message in JSON format.
  Act: Call the delete method with a URL expected to fail.
  Assert: Check that the method logs the error correctly and does not return a misleading success indicator.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures that the delete method correctly interprets and logs HTTP errors, which is essential for error handling and debugging.

### Scenario 5: DELETE Request with Invalid JSON in Response
Details:
  TestName: test_delete_with_invalid_json_response
  Description: Verify that the delete method can handle cases where the server returns a malformed JSON response.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the session's DELETE method to return a response object with status code 200 but containing invalid JSON.
  Act: Call the delete method with a valid URL.
  Assert: Check that the method handles the JSONDecodeError and returns the raw response content instead.
Validation:
  This test checks the robustness of the delete method in handling unexpected or malformed JSON responses, ensuring that the method remains functional even if the server response is not as expected.
