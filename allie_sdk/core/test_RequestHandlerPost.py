```
Scenario 1: Successful POST Request with JSON Body
Details:
  TestName: test_post_success_with_json_body
  Description: Verifies that the post method successfully handles a JSON body and returns the appropriate response.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the RequestHandler with mock session, host, and access token. Prepare a JSON body, headers, and URL.
  Act: Call the post method with the URL, JSON body, and headers.
  Assert: Check that the response is as expected and logs indicate a successful submission.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test by ensuring that the post method can correctly handle JSON bodies, a common use case in REST APIs, and logs success appropriately.

Scenario 2: POST Request with Invalid URL
Details:
  TestName: test_post_with_invalid_url
  Description: Ensures that the post method correctly handles cases where an invalid URL is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the RequestHandler with a mock session and an incorrect host URL. Prepare the POST body and headers.
  Act: Attempt to send a POST request using the incorrect URL.
  Assert: Verify that the error is logged correctly with appropriate error details.
Validation:
  This test validates the robustness of the API in error scenarios, ensuring error handling and logging are performed correctly when an invalid URL is used.

Scenario 3: POST Request with Network Failure
Details:
  TestName: test_post_with_network_failure
  Description: Tests the post method's handling of network issues like connection timeouts.
Execution:
  Arrange: Configure the mock session to raise a requests.exceptions.ConnectionError on post.
  Act: Call the post method and handle the exception.
  Assert: Check that the appropriate error is logged.
Validation:
  Validates the method's resilience and error handling under network failures, ensuring the stability and reliability of the API client.

Scenario 4: POST Request with Non-JSON Response
Details:
  TestName: test_post_with_non_json_response
  Description: Checks how the post method handles responses that do not contain JSON data.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the session's post to return a response with plain text or HTML.
  Act: Call the post method.
  Assert: Verify that the response is handled correctly without JSON parsing errors and logs the response appropriately.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the API can gracefully handle and log responses that are not in JSON format, which is crucial for robust API interactions.

Scenario 5: POST Request with File Upload
Details:
  TestName: test_post_with_file_upload
  Description: Verifies that the post method correctly handles file uploads.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a mock file and other POST parameters. Initialize the RequestHandler.
  Act: Send a POST request including the file in the files parameter.
  Assert: Check that the file is transmitted correctly and the response is as expected.
Validation:
  This test checks the functionality of file uploads, a critical feature for APIs that accept file data, ensuring that files are handled and transmitted correctly.

Scenario 6: POST Request with Custom Headers
Details:
  TestName: test_post_with_custom_headers
  Description: Ensures that the post method can handle custom headers correctly, especially when an access token is to be included.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the RequestHandler with an access token. Prepare custom headers and other POST parameters.
  Act: Send the POST request with custom headers.
  Assert: Verify that the headers include the access token and the request is processed correctly.
Validation:
  Validates the method's ability to handle authorization and other custom headers correctly, which is essential for secure and flexible API requests.
