### Test Scenarios for `async_patch` Method

#### Scenario 1: Successful Batch Processing without Errors
Details:
  TestName: test_async_patch_successful
  Description: Verify that the async_patch method processes all batches successfully without any failures.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the `_batch_objects` method to return multiple batches and `patch` method to simulate successful API responses. Also, mock `AlationJob` and its `check_job_status` method to return success.
  Act: Call `async_patch` with a sample URL and payload.
  Assert: Check that `async_patch` returns None indicating no failures.
Validation:
  Ensuring that the method processes batches correctly and handles successful patch operations indicates that the system can handle normal operations smoothly.

#### Scenario 2: Batch Processing with a Single Batch Failure
Details:
  TestName: test_async_patch_with_single_batch_failure
  Description: Ensure that `async_patch` returns True when at least one batch fails during processing.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock `_batch_objects` to return multiple batches, with the `patch` method failing (returning None) for one of the batches.
  Act: Invoke `async_patch` with a sample URL and payload.
  Assert: Check that `async_patch` returns True.
Validation:
  This test confirms that `async_patch` correctly identifies and reports the failure of any batch, which is crucial for error handling and reliability.

#### Scenario 3: Exception Handling During Batch Processing
Details:
  TestName: test_async_patch_exception_handling
  Description: Test that `async_patch` returns True when an exception is raised during the processing of a batch.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock `_batch_objects` to return multiple batches and simulate an exception in the `patch` method for one of the batches.
  Act: Invoke `async_patch`.
  Assert: Check that `async_patch` returns True.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the robustness of the error handling in `async_patch`, ensuring that exceptions do not crash the system and are reported correctly.

#### Scenario 4: Handling Empty Payload
Details:
  TestName: test_async_patch_empty_payload
  Description: Verify that `async_patch` handles an empty payload gracefully without errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide an empty list as the payload.
  Act: Call `async_patch` with this empty payload.
  Assert: Check that `async_patch` returns None, indicating no error.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method can handle edge cases such as an empty payload without unnecessary processing or errors.

#### Scenario 5: Large Batch Processing
Details:
  TestName: test_async_patch_large_batches
  Description: Verify that `async_patch` can handle a very large payload by splitting it into manageable batches.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a large payload and a small batch size to force multiple batches.
  Act: Call `async_patch` with the large payload.
  Assert: Check that all batches are processed without returning True.
Validation:
  Testing with large payloads ensures that the batching logic is effective and can handle data-intensive scenarios, which is essential for performance and scalability.

#### Scenario 6: Non-responsive Job Status Check
Details:
  TestName: test_async_patch_non_responsive_job_status
  Description: Ensure that `async_patch` handles scenarios where the job status check does not respond or fails.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock `AlationJob` to simulate a failure or non-responsive behavior in the `check_job_status` method.
  Act: Call `async_patch`.
  Assert: Test whether `async_patch` returns True due to the job status check issue.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures that the method can handle failures in dependent components like job status checks, which is critical for maintaining the overall robustness of the system.
