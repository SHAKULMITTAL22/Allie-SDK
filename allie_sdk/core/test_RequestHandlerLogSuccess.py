### Test Scenarios for `_log_success` Function

#### Scenario 1: Basic Logging Functionality
Details:
  TestName: test_log_success_basic_functionality
  Description: Verify if the logging function logs the correct message and details.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the `API_LOGGER.debug` method. Prepare a dictionary for `details` and a string for `message`.
  Act: Call `_log_success` with the prepared `details` and `message`.
  Assert: Check if `API_LOGGER.debug` was called once with the expected message and details.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the `_log_success` function correctly logs the given message and details, which is fundamental for tracking API call successes.

#### Scenario 2: Log Message with Special Characters
Details:
  TestName: test_log_success_with_special_characters_in_message
  Description: Test the logging with a message containing special characters to ensure it handles different character sets.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock `API_LOGGER.debug`. Use a message with special characters and a simple details dictionary.
  Act: Invoke `_log_success` with these parameters.
  Assert: Verify that `API_LOGGER.debug` logs the message correctly, without truncating or misinterpreting special characters.
Validation:
  This scenario checks the robustness of the logging function in handling messages with various character sets, crucial for internationalization and avoiding data corruption.

#### Scenario 3: Log Large Details Dictionary
Details:
  TestName: test_log_success_with_large_details_dictionary
  Description: Ensure that the function can handle a large details dictionary without performance degradation or errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock `API_LOGGER.debug`. Create a large details dictionary (e.g., with thousands of key-value pairs).
  Act: Call `_log_success` with this large dictionary and a standard message.
  Assert: Confirm that `API_LOGGER.debug` was called correctly with the large details.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the performance and capability of the logging function when handling larger payloads, which is vital for maintaining performance and reliability during extensive debugging sessions.

#### Scenario 4: Log Empty Details and Message
Details:
  TestName: test_log_success_empty_details_and_message
  Description: Check the function's behavior when passed an empty dictionary for details and an empty string for the message.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock `API_LOGGER.debug`.
  Act: Call `_log_success` with an empty dictionary and an empty string.
  Assert: Check that `API_LOGGER.debug` was called once with an empty message and details.
Validation:
  Validates the function's handling of minimal input, ensuring it doesn't fail or behave unexpectedly, which is essential for robustness.

#### Scenario 5: Logging with None Values
Details:
  TestName: test_log_success_with_none_values
  Description: Test how the function handles `None` values for both `details` and `message`.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock `API_LOGGER.debug`.
  Act: Call `_log_success` with `None` for both parameters.
  Assert: Verify that `API_LOGGER.debug` handles `None` inputs gracefully, either by logging them as 'None' or by not logging at all.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle `None` inputs, which might occur in dynamic environments, ensuring the logging mechanism is resilient against such cases.

Each of these scenarios ensures that `_log_success` behaves as expected across a range of typical and edge cases, validating both its functionality and its robustness.
