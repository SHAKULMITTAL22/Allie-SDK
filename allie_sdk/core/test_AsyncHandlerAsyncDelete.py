### Scenario 1: Successful Deletion of All Batches
Details:
  TestName: test_async_delete_successful_all_batches
  Description: Verifies that the async_delete method returns False when all batches are deleted successfully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a payload with multiple objects and a mock response simulating successful deletions for each batch.
  Act: Call the async_delete method with the prepared URL and payload.
  Assert: Check that the return value is False indicating no failures.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function behaves as expected when all delete operations succeed, which is a fundamental requirement for the reliability and accuracy of the deletion process.

### Scenario 2: Failure in One of the Batches
Details:
  TestName: test_async_delete_failure_in_one_batch
  Description: Tests whether async_delete returns True if any of the batches fail to delete.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a payload with multiple batches where one batch will simulate a failure.
  Act: Call the async_delete method with this setup.
  Assert: The method should return True, indicating a failure occurred.
Validation:
  This scenario checks the robustness of the method in handling errors correctly across multiple batches, ensuring that any failure is caught and reported accurately.

### Scenario 3: Exception Handling During Batch Deletion
Details:
  TestName: test_async_delete_exception_handling
  Description: Ensures that async_delete handles exceptions during the deletion process and returns True.
Execution:
  Arrange: Configure the delete method to raise an exception for at least one batch.
  Act: Execute the async_delete method with a payload expected to trigger the exception.
  Assert: Verify that the method returns True, indicating a failure due to the exception.
Validation:
  This test validates the method's ability to handle unexpected situations gracefully, which is critical for maintaining stability and providing reliable feedback on operation success.

### Scenario 4: Empty Payload Handling
Details:
  TestName: test_async_delete_empty_payload
  Description: Checks the behavior of async_delete when an empty payload is passed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Call async_delete with an empty list as the payload.
  Act: Invoke the method and observe the behavior.
  Assert: The method should return False, indicating no failure since no operation was performed.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures that the method can correctly handle cases where there is no data to process, avoiding unnecessary operations or errors.

### Scenario 5: Batch Processing with Default Batch Size
Details:
  TestName: test_async_delete_default_batch_size
  Description: Verifies that the method correctly batches and processes the payload when no specific batch size is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a payload large enough to be split into multiple default-sized batches.
  Act: Call async_delete without specifying a batch size.
  Assert: Ensure that the payload is batched correctly and that the method processes each batch as expected.
Validation:
  Testing default behavior is crucial to confirm that the system performs as intended under typical conditions without explicit parameter specification.

### Scenario 6: Batch Processing with Specific Batch Size
Details:
  TestName: test_async_delete_specific_batch_size
  Description: Ensures that async_delete correctly handles payloads when a specific batch size is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a payload and a specific batch size that alters the default batching behavior.
  Act: Call async_delete with this specific batch size.
  Assert: Check that the payload is batched according to the specified size and each batch is processed correctly.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the method is flexible and adheres to user-defined constraints, which is important for handling various operational scenarios effectively.

Each of these scenarios provides a comprehensive evaluation of the `async_delete` method, ensuring it operates correctly across different situations and handles errors and edge cases effectively.
