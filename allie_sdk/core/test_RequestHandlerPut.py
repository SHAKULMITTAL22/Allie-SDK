**Scenario 1: Successful PUT request with valid body and query parameters**
Details:
  TestName: test_put_success_with_body_and_query_params
  Description: Verifies that the `put` method correctly handles a successful PUT request with a valid body and query parameters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the session's PUT method to return a successful HTTP response with a JSON body. Initialize the `RequestHandler` object.
  Act: Call the `put` method with a valid URL, body, and query parameters.
  Assert: Check that the response is correctly parsed from JSON and matches the expected result.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the `put` method processes successful responses correctly and handles JSON data as expected, which is essential for the method's primary functionality of updating resources via the PUT request.

**Scenario 2: PUT request with a body that is not JSON serializable**
Details:
  TestName: test_put_with_non_serializable_body
  Description: Tests the `put` method's handling of a body that cannot be JSON serialized.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use a body that is not JSON serializable (e.g., a Python object). Mock the session's PUT method. Initialize the `RequestHandler`.
  Act: Call the `put` method with this body.
  Assert: Expect a specific exception or error handling response indicating serialization failure.
Validation:
  This scenario validates the robustness of the `put` method in handling data serialization errors, which is crucial for maintaining data integrity and providing meaningful error feedback.

**Scenario 3: PUT request resulting in a non-success HTTP status code**
Details:
  TestName: test_put_non_success_status_code
  Description: Ensures that the `put` method correctly logs and handles HTTP responses that indicate an error (non-success status code).
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the session's PUT method to return a response with an error status code and an error message in the body. Initialize the `RequestHandler`.
  Act: Call the `put` method with typical input parameters.
  Assert: Check that the error is logged correctly and that the method does not return a misleading success indication.
Validation:
  This test is important to verify that the method properly handles error cases from the server, logs them appropriately, and does not propagate incorrect success signals to the caller.

**Scenario 4: PUT request with network or low-level HTTP error**
Details:
  TestName: test_put_with_network_error
  Description: Verifies the method's resilience and error handling in the face of network-related issues like timeouts or connection errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the session's PUT method to raise a `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`. Initialize the `RequestHandler`.
  Act: Call the `put` method.
  Assert: Expect the method to handle the exception gracefully, possibly by logging it and not crashing.
Validation:
  Testing the method's behavior under network failure conditions is crucial to ensuring that the application can gracefully handle such issues without crashing, thus maintaining a robust interface with external systems.

**Scenario 5: PUT request where the server returns non-JSON and non-text content**
Details:
  TestName: test_put_response_with_non_json_content
  Description: Tests how the `put` method deals with responses that contain neither JSON nor plain text content, such as binary data.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the session's PUT method to return a response with binary data. Initialize the `RequestHandler`.
  Act: Call the `put` method.
  Assert: Check that the method handles or logs the unexpected format appropriately.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures that the `put` method can handle unexpected response formats without failing, which is important for robustness, especially when interfacing with APIs that might return a variety of content types.
