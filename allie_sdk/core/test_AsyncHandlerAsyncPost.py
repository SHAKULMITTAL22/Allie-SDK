### Scenario 1: Successful Batch Post
Details:
  TestName: test_successful_batch_post
  Description: This test verifies that the async_post method processes and completes all batches successfully without any failures.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an instance with valid access_token, session, and host. Prepare a payload that can be batched correctly.
  Act: Call async_post with the URL, payload, and optional batch size.
  Assert: Check that the return value is False indicating no failures.
Validation:
  Verifying a successful batch processing is crucial as it confirms that the system can handle valid data correctly under normal circumstances.

### Scenario 2: Failed Batch Post Due to Network Error
Details:
  TestName: test_failed_batch_post_due_to_network_error
  Description: Ensures that the async_post method correctly identifies and handles batch failures due to network-related issues.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the instance with necessary parameters. Mock the post method to simulate a network error.
  Act: Call async_post with parameters that would trigger the mocked behavior.
  Assert: Check that the return value is True, indicating a failure.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm the resilience of the method against external failures such as network issues, ensuring robust error handling.

### Scenario 3: Handling of Empty Payload
Details:
  TestName: test_handling_empty_payload
  Description: Verifies that the async_post method handles an empty payload gracefully without errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Pass an empty list as the payload.
  Act: Call async_post with the empty payload.
  Assert: Ensure the return value is False, indicating no errors.
Validation:
  Testing with an empty payload checks the function’s robustness and its ability to handle edge cases gracefully.

### Scenario 4: Handling of Large Payload with Batching
Details:
  TestName: test_large_payload_with_batching
  Description: Tests the async_post method's ability to handle large payloads by correctly batching them into smaller, manageable sizes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a large payload that exceeds a typical single batch size.
  Act: Call async_post with this payload and a specified batch size.
  Assert: Verify that the payload is batched correctly and that the method completes without returning True.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures that the method can process large amounts of data efficiently by utilizing batching, which is critical for performance and resource management.

### Scenario 5: Batch Failure on Invalid API Endpoint
Details:
  TestName: test_batch_failure_on_invalid_api_endpoint
  Description: Ensures that the async_post method properly handles the scenario where the API endpoint provided is invalid.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide an invalid URL along with a normal payload and batch size.
  Act: Call async_post with these parameters.
  Assert: The method should return True, indicating a handling of the failure.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's error handling capabilities when faced with incorrect API endpoints, which is vital for ensuring reliability in adverse conditions.

### Scenario 6: Exception Handling During Batch Processing
Details:
  TestName: test_exception_handling_during_batch_processing
  Description: Tests the async_post’s robustness in handling unexpected exceptions during batch processing.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock an exception to be thrown during the batch processing.
  Act: Execute async_post to trigger the mocked exception.
  Assert: Verify that the method returns True, indicating it recognized and handled the exception.
Validation:
  Handling exceptions gracefully is crucial for maintaining stability and preventing the application from crashing during unexpected conditions.
