```
Scenario 1: Basic functionality with specified batch size
Details:
  TestName: test_batch_objects_with_specific_batch_size
  Description: Verify that the function correctly batches objects into specified batch sizes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a list of objects and a specific batch size.
  Act: Call the _batch_objects function with the list and the specified batch size.
  Assert: Check that the returned list of batches matches the expected number of batches and batch sizes.
Validation:
  Rationalizes that the function handles the specified batch size correctly and divides the list into the expected number of batches, ensuring that each batch does not exceed the specified size.

Scenario 2: Basic functionality with default batch size
Details:
  TestName: test_batch_objects_with_default_batch_size
  Description: Verify that the function correctly uses the default batch size when none is specified.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a list of objects without specifying a batch size.
  Act: Call the _batch_objects function only with the list.
  Assert: Check that the returned list of batches uses the default batch size.
Validation:
  Ensures that the function defaults to an internally set batch size correctly when none is provided, maintaining functionality across varied use cases.

Scenario 3: Empty object list
Details:
  TestName: test_batch_objects_empty_list
  Description: Verify that the function handles an empty list of objects correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use an empty list of objects.
  Act: Call the _batch_objects function with this empty list.
  Assert: Ensure that the function returns an empty list.
Validation:
  Validates that the function gracefully handles edge cases where there are no objects to batch, preventing any errors or unnecessary processing.

Scenario 4: Single object with batch size larger than one object
Details:
  TestName: test_single_object_with_larger_batch_size
  Description: Verify that a single object is correctly handled when the batch size is larger than one.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a list with one object and set a batch size larger than one.
  Act: Call the _batch_objects function with this setup.
  Assert: Check that the function returns a list containing only one batch with the single object.
Validation:
  Ensures that the function correctly batches single objects into a batch of their own when the specified batch size exceeds the number of objects, maintaining data integrity.

Scenario 5: Objects not divisible by batch size
Details:
  TestName: test_objects_not_divisible_by_batch_size
  Description: Verify that the function correctly handles cases where the number of objects is not perfectly divisible by the batch size.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a list of objects where the number is not divisible by the chosen batch size.
  Act: Call the _batch_objects function with this list and batch size.
  Assert: Check that the last batch contains the correct number of leftover objects.
Validation:
  Validates that the function can handle any remainder objects correctly, ensuring all objects are processed without being left out.

Scenario 6: Extremely large batch size
Details:
  TestName: test_large_batch_size
  Description: Test the function's behavior when the batch size is significantly larger than the number of objects.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a list of objects and set a batch size much larger than the number of objects.
  Act: Call the _batch_objects function with this setup.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns a single batch containing all objects.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle unusually large batch sizes by not unnecessarily dividing objects into smaller groups, which might affect performance and usability in scenarios requiring large batch operations.
